Installation instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------

We assume that you already have installed a C++ IDE and if you want to run locally, a local version of LibTorch. You also need CMake (version >=3.21). Most IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio) are supplied with CMake, if you install the right plugins.

Setup
-----

For the easiest setup, provide a ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` in the root directory. Note: ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` in the root directory is ignored by Git. This allows for passing in specific configurations and paths tailored to your local environment. An example file can be found at ``cmake/resources/``. You could copy this to the root directory, and adapt it to your specific needs.

.. hint::
    Visual Studio and other IDEs often hide files and folders that are ignored in Git, in settings you can set ignored files to visible.

The ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` should provide paths to certain dependencies (e.g., ``PyTorch``). You also need to provide ``DYNAPLEX_IO_ROOT_DIR``, which is a local directory where input and output files used and generated by DynaPlex will be stored and retrieved from.

Windows
-------

With the setup in place, compiling the library should be straightforward in most IDEs that support CMake (possibly via a proper extension).

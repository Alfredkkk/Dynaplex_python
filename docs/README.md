# Documentation

Here we host the documentation for readthedocs.
As long as the GitHub project is still `private`, the documentation is build an can be found by opening this link (todo)

Note:
Since the repo is private, we cannot host readthedocs yet from this folder. Only way to see the visualized docs page is by building it (see build_docs.md)

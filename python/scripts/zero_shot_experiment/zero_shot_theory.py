Zero-Shot Generalization in Inventory Management with DynaPlex

"Zero-shot Generalization in Inventory Management: Train, then Estimate and Decide"
by Temiz√∂z et al. (2024).

The key concept: Train a neural network policy on a specific parameter setting,

ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZATION IN INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
================================================

The paper introduces a method for applying a trained deep reinforcement learning
policy to new parameter settings without retraining - a concept called zero-shot
generalization.

OVERVIEW OF THE APPROACH:
------------------------

1. TRAINING PHASE:
   - Choose a base parameter setting (e.g., leadtime=3, penalty=9.0, demand_mean=4.0)
   - Train a DNN policy using Deep Controlled Learning (DCL) or other RL methods
   - This creates a neural network that maps state features to order decisions

2. ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZATION PHASE:
   - Take the trained policy and apply it to a new parameter setting
   - The key insight: The trained network has learned to make decisions based on state features
   - Even when underlying system parameters change, the network can still make reasonable decisions
     if the state representation captures the essential information

IMPLEMENTATION WITH DYNAPLEX:
----------------------------

In theory, this could be implemented with DynaPlex as follows:

```python
# 1. Train a policy on base parameters
base_params = {"leadtime": 3, "p": 9.0, "h": 1.0, "demand_mean": 4.0}
mdp = dynaplex.get_mdp(id="lost_sales", **base_params)
# Train policy using DCL...
trained_policy = train_dcl_policy(mdp)

# 2. Test the policy on different parameters
new_params = {"leadtime": 5, "p": 9.0, "h": 1.0, "demand_mean": 4.0}
new_mdp = dynaplex.get_mdp(id="lost_sales", **new_params)
zero_shot_policy = dynaplex.load_policy(new_mdp, trained_policy_path)
```

CHALLENGES:
----------

The main challenge is that different parameter settings often change the state
representation dimensions. For example:
- Changing leadtime affects the state vector size (more leadtime periods = larger state)
- This causes matrix dimension mismatches when applying the trained network to new states

SOLUTIONS FROM THE PAPER:
-----------------------

1. FEATURE STANDARDIZATION:
   - Design a fixed-size state representation that works across parameter settings
   - Standardize features to make them comparable across different settings

2. PARAMETER AUGMENTATION:
   - Include the environment parameters (leadtime, penalty, demand) as part of the state
   - This allows the network to adapt its decisions based on the system parameters
   
3. TWO-STEP APPROACH:
   - Train the DNN to predict optimal base-stock levels rather than direct actions
   - Apply the predicted base-stock level to the current state to determine actions
   
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
-------------------

The paper shows that:
- Across different penalty costs (p): The zero-shot policy performs well
- Across different leadtimes: Reasonable performance for small changes, degrades for larger changes
- Across different demand distributions: Good generalization abilities

The performance of zero-shot generalization depends on:
- How similar the new environment is to the training environment
- Whether the learned policy captures fundamental decision-making principles
- The capacity of the neural network architecture

/// Example MDP configuration file. 
/// - Files under models/_subdir_/_filename_.json are copied to DYNAPLEX_IO_ROOT_DIR/IO_DynaPlex/defaults/_subdir_/_filename_.json
/// where executable and unit_tests look for them. 
/// - Providing example MDP configuration files is not required, but serves as documentation of the MDP.
/// - It also simplifies unit_tests, see tests/mdp_unit_tests/*.cpp.
